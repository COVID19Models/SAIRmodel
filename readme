The paper essentially consists of 3 sections namely :

1. Parameter estimation
2. SAIR model solution
3. Herd immunity calculation

There are separate readme files in all the folders with specific details

The only input required for the codes to run is COVID19 time series data for various countries which was taken from "www.worldometers.com"
