Parameter Estimation

This section is further divided into 4 parts.
alpha, beta, gamma, delta are the parameters of the SAIR model that need to be estimated using real data. The procedure is done for 4 countries, namely : France, Japan, Switzerland and Italy.

In each folder data files with the names "I.data", "Idot.data", "R.data", "Rdot.data" are all INPUT files. They consist of the daily reported infections and recoveries for various countries.
The time series data was taken from "www.worldometers.com"

Running the "main_%%%.cpp" files in each folder, throws out output files which can be copied into the "figures" folder to generate plots with necessary data fitting.
